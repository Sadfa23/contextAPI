# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
# contextAPI
Context API is a feature of React that allows for the efficient management of global state in your application without the need to prop-drill. By using the Context API, you can create a context that holds state and functions, and provide them to any component in your component tree. This reduces redundancy, improves code maintainability, and enhances performance by minimizing unnecessary re-renders. The Context API is a great alternative to other state management solutions for managing simple to moderately complex state.
No more prop-drillingðŸ˜Ž
